<p> As the most prominent female figure during Mexico’s War for Independence waged from 1810-1821, <b> Leona Vicario</b>
  is called,<q> La Patria Madre de Mexico</q>. which translates to <q> Distinguished and Beloved Mother of the Homeland</q>.
</p>

<h2> Early Life </h2>
  <p> Leona Vicario was born April 10, 1789 in Mexico City to well-to-do parents.
Her father was a merchant from Spain and her mother was from an equally wealthy family from San Salvador; 
several sources state both her parents were Spanish. She was raised in a wealthy, exclusive, highly educated lifestyle
by her parents until she was 18, whereupon both died and left her in the care of her paternal uncle, who practiced law,
Agustin Fernandez de San Salvador Pompous. At 18 yers of age she had acquired an invaluable education, which she put to use by 
by filing for legal independence from her uncle, which allowed her to make all financial and legal decions in her own interest.</p>
<br>
<p> Leona had significant social standing in New Spain’s (Mexico)racist caste system that 
was forcefully imposed on it by the Spanish. The 16th century Spaniards, along with their overlords in the Roman Catholic Church, 
were so obsessed with race that they produced posters commissioned by artists to describe the 16 official <q>racial mixtures</q> 
along with their legal statuses. Because of Leona’s heritage, she was publicly acknowledged at the top of society heirarchy.
 It made her nearly untouchable when it came to capital crimes, along with a wealth of social privileges.</p>
  
  <br>
  <p> Leona's extensive education had given her a foundation to develop critical thinking skills, which encouraged 
   independence from the pervasive patriarchy of New Spain (Mexico). Her attention soon turned to revolutionary idealists, at 
   great personal risk. It also brought her to the attention of a succesful lawyer, Andres Quintana Roo. 
   The pair eventually married.</p>
  <br>
  <h3> Los Guadalupes </h3>
  <p> Leona joined Los Guadalupes, a secret rebel society receiving and distributing correspondence for the independence
   of New Spain from the Spanish Crown. Leona expanded her involvement by using her banking connections
   to secretly finance various stages of the rebellion.She furthered her commitment by directly buying arms and 
   acquiring materials to make cannons and artillery. Leona also arranged the purchase and shipment of medicines to Vera Cruz. 
   She secretly transported them to neighborhoodsin Mexico City where she also hid revolutionary compatriots. 
   <br>
   Not content as a rebel and arms dealer, Leona then teamed with Quintana Roo to perfect her journalistic prose and write political articles. 
   He provided his family’s printing presses to produce their liberal political ideas for the masses. Leona’s revolutionary networks
   then distributed those leaflets, informing the public of Spanish atrocities towards Native and Mestizo civilians, crimes associated 
   with the established social caste system, and the need to obtain self-rule independent of Spain.</P
