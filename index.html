<p> As the most prominent female figure during Mexico’s War for Independence waged from 1810-1821, <b> Leona Vicario</b>
  is called,<q> La Patria Madre de Mexico</q>. which translates to <q> Distinguished and Beloved Mother of the Homeland</q>.
</p>

<h2> Early Life </h2>
  <p> Leona Vicario was born April 10, 1789 in Mexico City to well-to-do parents.
Her father was a merchant from Spain and her mother was from an equally wealthy family from San Salvador; 
several sources state both her parents were Spanish. She was raised in a wealthy, exclusive, highly educated lifestyle
by her parents until she was 18, when both died and left her in the care of her lawyer uncle, 
Agustin Fernandez de San Salvador Pompous. By that time she had acquired an invaluable education and learned
science, art, painting, singing and literature.</p>
<br>
<p> Leona had significant social standing in New Spain’s (Mexico)racist caste system that 
was forcefully imposed on it by the Spanish. The 16th century Spaniards, along with their overlords in the Roman Catholic Church, 
were so obsessed with race that they produced posters commissioned by artists to describe the 16 official <q>racial mixtures</q> 
along with their legal statuses. Because of Leona’s heritage, she was publicly acknowledged at the top of society heirarchy.
 It made her nearly untouchable when it came to capital crimes, along with a wealth of social privileges.</p>
